I am Fucong Dai, currently in my third year as an undergraduate student in the Turing Class at Peking University.

I was trained in algorithm and programming contests during my high school career. The training process develops my algorithm designing and coding abilities. I won the gold medal in NOI2020(National Olympiad in Informatics 2020). I continued to participate in ICPC contests in a team of three students after starting undergraduate study, and our team won multiple gold medals in ICPC regional contests and secured a gold medal in ICPC EC-final.

During the first two years of undergraduate study, I mainly focused on completing the academic curriculum. As the most important and central courses in the curriculum is about basic principles of computer systems and network, I had spent a lot of time exploring research in the field of systems and networks.

However, the rapid development of large-scale models and their extraordinary capabilities prompted me to stop and think about what I should do in the new AI era. Then my attention shifted towards AI. Recently I have been studying AI basic technologies and exploring the latest achievements in the field of AI. Now I am trying to join and contribute to a project centered on model scaling for large-scale models. I hope I will be able to follow and contribute to the dynamic field of AI in the future.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
